- This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis focused on the Lending Club Case Study.
- Problem Statement: Consumer finance company specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
The company aims to reduce credit loss by identifying risky loan applicants. Specifically, they want to understand the driving factors or variables that strongly indicate loan default.
The customers labeled as 'charged-off' are considered defaulters.
